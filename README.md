 ## About The Project

A credit card detection model employing machine learning is a sophisticated system designed to identify and flag fraudulent transactions within vast datasets.
Leveraging algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks, the model analyzes various features associated with each transaction, including transaction amount, location, time, and purchasing patterns. 
Through iterative training on historical data containing both legitimate and fraudulent transactions, the model learns to distinguish between normal and suspicious activities, continuously improving its accuracy over time. 
By automatically detecting anomalies and suspicious patterns, this model plays a pivotal role in safeguarding financial institutions and their customers against fraudulent activities, ensuring secure transactions and maintaining trust in the financial ecosystem.

 ### Built With

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)
- [Pandas]
- [Numpy]
- [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
 ## Getting Started
 This model can be made using Machibe learning.
 One can you use google colab and start coiding.
 Basics of Machine learning and python is needed.

 ### Prerequisites

 - Basics of Machine Learing
 - Python 
 - Numpy 
 - Pandas

 ## Usage

Predicting whether it is the cardholders or the fraudsters using the credit cards through credit card profiling. Using outlier detection methods to identify considerably different transactions (or 'outliers') from regular credit cards transactions to detect credit card fraud.
