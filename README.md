<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A credit card detection model employing machine learning is a sophisticated system designed to identify and flag fraudulent transactions within vast datasets.
Leveraging algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks, the model analyzes various features associated with each transaction, including transaction amount, location, time, and purchasing patterns.
Through iterative training on historical data containing both legitimate and fraudulent transactions, the model learns to distinguish between normal and suspicious activities, continuously improving its accuracy over time.
By automatically detecting anomalies and suspicious patterns, this model plays a pivotal role in safeguarding financial institutions and their customers against fraudulent activities, ensuring secure transactions and maintaining trust in the financial ecosystem.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

In this section, you will get to know how this repo can be recreated for your project.

### Dependencies

Here, list all libraries, packages and other dependencies that need to be installed to run your project. Include library versions and how they should be installed if a special requirement is needed.

> Make sure you make requirements.txt having all the dependencies required to run the code

For example, this is how you would list them:

- Installing all dependencies
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Example of requirements.txt
  ```sh
  GoogleColab
  opencv-python
  numpy
  pandas
  scikit-learn
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mushir2004/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-
   ```
2. Setup (and activate) your environment

```sh
your running etc
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage - Problem Statement and Your solution

Techniques:

Machine Learning: These models learn from historical data labeled as fraudulent or legitimate transactions. Common algorithms include:
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Logistic Regression
Artificial Neural Networks
Naive Bayes
Unsupervised Learning: This approach identifies unusual spending patterns that might indicate fraud.
Data:

Transaction details like amount, location, time, and merchant.
Cardholder information like billing address and spending habits.
Challenges:

Imbalanced data: Most transactions are legitimate, making fraud cases rare and requiring special evaluation metrics.
Evolving fraud schemes: Models need to adapt to new tricks used by fraudsters.
Benefits:

Protects cardholders from financial loss.
Reduces fraud costs for banks and other institutions.
Enables real-time fraud detection for faster intervention.
